I've created a complete multiple sequence alignment analysis for your 4 protein sequences. Here's what you get:
Your Results:

Alignment created showing how all 4 sequences align with gaps
Pairwise similarity: Your sequences are fairly diverse, ranging from ~6-22% identity
Conservation analysis: 41.7% average conservation, with 2 highly conserved positions and 46 moderately conserved ones
